    <div class="para">
        <p1>Since our inception in 2011, our goal has always been to help broadcasters both big and small successes.
            Beginning with a single service, over the past decade, our service offering has greatly expanded to include
            world-class streaming, a self-serve radio management platform, mobile apps, the Zeno.fm web directory, and
            more.

        </p1>

    <div class="para2">
        <p2>We have also developed innovative monetization strategies, including our audio fingerprinting technology:
            MAZ (Maximizing Advertising Zones). MAZ detects when a local radio station plays an ad, and automatically
            replaces it with an ad that is relevant to the listenerâ€™s geographic location. This ensures listeners always
            receive an ad that is relevant to them.
